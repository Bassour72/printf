# I created the ft_printf function in C, which is a custom implementation of the standard printf. 
# It handles the printing of various data types, including characters, integers, strings, and memory addresses. 
# In addition, it supports printing hexadecimal values and includes flags like space, zero-padding, hash, plus, and minus. 
# This powerful function allows for flexible and detailed output formatting, making it a versatile tool in any C programming project.
